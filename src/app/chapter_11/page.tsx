        Chapter 11: Strategies for one-to-many relationships
      </PageTitle>
      <Paragraph>
        A one-to-many relationship is when a particular object is the owner or
        source for a number of sub-objects. For example, Workplace: A single
        office will have many employees working there; a single manager may have
        many direct reports. With one-to-many relationships, thereâ€™s one core
        problem: how do I fetch information about the parent entity when
        retrieving one or more of the related entities?
