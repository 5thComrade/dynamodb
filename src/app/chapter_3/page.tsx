      <Paragraph>
        In this chapter, weâ€™re going to cover some advanced concepts in
        DynamoDB.

      <Paragraph>
        A few of these concepts, like DynamoDB streams and time-to-live (TTL)
        will allow you to handle more advanced use cases with DynamoDB. Other
        concepts, like partitions, consistency, and DynamoDB limits, will give
        you a better understanding of proper data modeling with DynamoDB.
        Finally, the concept of overloaded keys and indexes is a data modeling
        concept that will be used frequently in your data modeling.
